# School District Analysis

I was recently hired as a data analyst and I was asked to collaborate with Maria to analyse data on district and charter school student funding, student test scores, and showcase trends in school performance.
To start this analysis, I used Jupyter Notebook, which is an application that allows its users to create and share documents that contain live code, among other functions.
The main tasks of this analysis were to collect data, prepare data and analyse data that we received from a CSV file.

## Summary

This analysis allowed me to first check for duplicate information in my dataset and clean it up, to make sure I got accurate results at the end of the analysis.

I was also able to get the summary statistics from the data frame, and that information can be crucial and lead to further analysis.

Cleaning, preparing, and summarizing the data creates the perfect starting point for looking for interesting correlations between values (grades, school name, reading score, math score, school type, and budget).

Our analysis focuses primarily on school and student performance based on student scores in grades 9, 10, 11, and 12 on their math and reading tests.

## Report Findings

- Some of the most important findings are that the average math score for all schools is 64.675.

- The minimum score in reading is 10.5 for a Dixon High School 10th grader.

- And the mean for all 11th and 12th graders in math is 63.258, which is fairly similar to the mean for all the students mentioned above.

- Finally, we can see that charter school students performed better on their math tests compared to public school students.
